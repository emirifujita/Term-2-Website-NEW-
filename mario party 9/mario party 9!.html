<h3> Personal Connections </h3>
<p>When I was in first grade, I got my first ever Nintendo DS Lite from my uncle. I remember playing a bunch of games downloaded in a game chip that came with the console. One game I certainly enjoyed was Mario party 9. I remember playing it for several hours until my mom would confiscate my DS for playing it for so long. The minigames were very addictive and winning each one felt really good.</p>
